      <h2>Accommodation and places to visit</h2>

      <b>Accommodation</b>
      <p>We recommend that you try to find accommodation as soon as possible because the Royal Highland Show will take place from June 19th to June 22nd, making it harder to find accommodation. We will be posting some accommodation suggestions here later on.</p>      
      
      <b>Meals</b>
      <p>There are plenty of great options for dinner in the area, including:<br>Wee Greek Kitchen, Haldi, Salisbury Arms, Old Bell Inn, Matto Pizza, Korean BBQ, Verdo, Sofia's Lounge, Brass Monkey, and Leslie's Bar.
      </p>
      
      <b>Tour around Edinburgh</b>
      <p>On Wednesday afternoon, we plan to go for a small tour of Edinburgh. In case you can't join/want to explore Edinburgh on your own, here are some suggestions:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>The Old Town features the Royal Mile with Edinburgh Castle on one end and Holyrood Palace on the other.</li>
      <li>Located right next to the Old Town, Arthur's Seat in Holyrood Park offers great views of Edinburgh.</li>
      <li>Blackford Hill is part of a lovely park that is great for walks and located just west of the campus.</li>
      <li>Craigmillar Castle is the ruins of a castle that used to be outside of Edinburgh and is now conveniently close.</li>
      <li>Edinburgh has lots of museums, many of which are free. Highlights include the National Museum of Scotland (similar to the British Museum), Surgeons' Hall (bizarre medical exposition), and the Museum of Edinburgh (history of Edinburgh).</li>
      </ul>
